A responsive calculator app for iOS + iPadOS.

## Goal
Create a useful scientific calculator that is consistent and can run on both iOS and iPadOS. 

The motivation for this project is to create something that resembles Apple's default calculator app but clean enough to integrate with iPadOS. There are already plenty of calculators out there but this has zero ads and also gives all features for free.

## Screenshots
Screenshots are currently out of date. There is also a new icon and extra customisation being implemented into the calculator.
